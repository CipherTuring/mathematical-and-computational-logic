% Instructions for each technique
% ------------------------------------
instructions("Flashcards",
    "Cards with questions and answers to review concepts.",
    ["Write the question on one side",
     "Write the answer on the other side",
     "Review daily and reorganize depending on difficulty"]).

instructions("Audio review",
    "Listen to recorded notes or lectures to reinforce memory.",
    ["Record your notes or lectures",
     "Play them back during free time",
     "Repeat regularly to reinforce information"]).

instructions("Spaced repetition",
    "Reviewing material at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention.",
    ["Use flashcards or questions",
     "Review after 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week, etc.",
     "Focus more on difficult items"]).

instructions("Summarization",
    "Summarizing key ideas to strengthen understanding.",
    ["Read the material carefully",
     "Write down the main points in your own words",
     "Review your summaries before exams"]).

instructions("Self-explanation",
    "Explaining the material to yourself as if teaching someone else.",
    ["Read a concept or solve a problem",
     "Explain the reasoning out loud or in writing",
     "Identify gaps in understanding and clarify them"]).

instructions("Mind Mapping",
    "A visual diagram to organize and connect concepts.",
    ["Write the main topic in the center",
     "Add branches for key subtopics",
     "Connect ideas with arrows and keywords"]).

instructions("Practice-problems",
    "Solving exercises to strengthen comprehension.",
    ["Find practice questions or problems",
     "Try solving without looking at notes",
     "Check answers and learn from mistakes"]).

instructions("Highlighting",
    "Marking key concepts for quick review.",
    ["Read the material once fully",
     "Highlight only the essential ideas",
     "Use different colors for categories"]).

instructions("Pomodoro Technique",
    "Time management technique with short study sessions and breaks.",
    ["Study for 25 minutes",
     "Take a 5-minute break",
     "Repeat 4 times",
     "After 4 cycles, take a long break (15â€“30 minutes)"]).
