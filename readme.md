# Mathematical and Computational Logic  
  
Welcome to this repository!  
Here I will upload several activities from my course on **Mathematical and Computational Logic** taught at **Yachay Tech University**, which I consider one of the most fascinating and essential areas of theoretical computer science.

This repository is intended to serve as a resource for both future students of the subject and anyone interested in the topic. It is a place where logic is not just theory, but also a tool for problem solving and programming using **Prolog**.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Description  

**Mathematical and Computational Logic** focuses on the formal principles that allow us to **reason, prove, and compute**.  

Why is this important?  

- It forms the **core foundation of theoretical computer science**.  
- It connects directly to **artificial intelligence**, **program verification**, and **algorithm design**.  
- It provides the tools to understand how computers can **reason symbolically**.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  

This repository is centered on **Prolog**, a declarative programming language that allows us to:  

- Represent facts and rules using predicate logic.  
- Perform automated reasoning through queries.  
- Explore how inference systems apply logical rules to deduce new information.
